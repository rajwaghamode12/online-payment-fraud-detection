# FraudShield AI — Online Payment Fraud Detection System

> **Academic Demo System** — Uses synthetic data only. Not for real banking use.

A full-stack, machine-learning-powered web application that detects fraudulent online payment transactions using a multi-layer AI pipeline combining ML Classification, Anomaly Detection, Behavioural Analysis, Velocity Detection, Dynamic Risk Scoring, and Explainable AI.

---

## Problem Statement

Online payment fraud costs billions of dollars globally every year. Traditional rule-based systems struggle to keep up with evolving fraud patterns. This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to automatically detect suspicious transactions by analysing multiple signals simultaneously.

---

## Objectives

- Detect fraudulent transactions using ML classification models
- Identify statistical anomalies using Isolation Forest
- Analyse user behavioural patterns to flag deviations
- Detect high-frequency transaction bursts (velocity)
- Combine all signals into a single explainable Risk Score (0–100)
- Provide an admin review workflow with feedback-based learning
- Monitor model performance and detect model drift

## Model Training

Train all four ML models and generate performance metrics:

```bash
python model/train_model.py
```

This will:
1. Generate the synthetic dataset (if not present)
2. Train: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost
3. Apply SMOTE oversampling
4. Train Isolation Forest for anomaly detection
5. Save: `model/fraud_model.pkl`, `model/preprocessor.pkl`, `model/model_performance.json`
6. Print actual performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC)

Training takes approximately 30–60 seconds on a standard laptop.

## Class Imbalance Handling

The synthetic dataset has ~10% fraud rate — a realistic imbalance. The system handles this with:

1. **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) — generates synthetic fraud samples in the training set
2. **class_weight='balanced'** — used in Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
3. **scale_pos_weight** — used in XGBoost

Why accuracy alone is not enough: with 90% genuine and 10% fraud, a model that always predicts "genuine" would achieve 90% accuracy while catching zero frauds. That is why **Recall**, **Precision**, **F1-score**, and **ROC-AUC** are the primary metrics here.

---

## Risk Engine Weights

| Signal | Weight |
|---|---|
| ML Fraud Probability | 35% |
| Anomaly Score (Isolation Forest) | 20% |
| Behavioural Score | 20% |
| Velocity Score | 10% |
| New Device | 8% |
| Unusual Location | 7% |

These thresholds are for demonstration purposes and are not official banking standards.

## Security Considerations

- Passwords hashed with Werkzeug PBKDF2 (never stored in plain text)
- SQL injection protection via parameterised SQLite queries
- Session-based authentication with configurable timeout
- Role-based access control (user vs admin)
- Input validation on all forms and API endpoints
- No real card numbers, CVVs, PINs, or OTPs collected
- Environment variables for secrets (.env file)

This system is **not production-ready** without additional security review, HTTPS, rate limiting, WAF, regulatory compliance, and infrastructure hardening.

---

## Limitations

- Uses synthetic data — real-world fraud patterns are more complex
- Risk thresholds are heuristic, not derived from real banking standards
- No real-time connection to payment networks
- Retraining is triggered manually, not automatically
- Graph analysis is visual only — no graph database
- Geographic risk uses city names only, not real coordinates

---

## Future Improvements

- Deep learning models (LSTM for sequence-based fraud detection)
- Graph Neural Networks for relationship-based fraud detection
- Real-time streaming with Apache Kafka
- AutoML for automated hyperparameter tuning
- Multi-factor authentication
- Kubernetes deployment with horizontal scaling
- Integration with actual payment gateway sandboxes (demo only)
- Federated learning for privacy-preserving model training

---

## Disclaimer

This project is built for **academic and demonstration purposes only**. It uses entirely synthetic, randomly-generated data. No real card numbers, PINs, OTPs, bank passwords, or personal financial information are collected or processed. The risk thresholds shown are not official banking standards. This system should not be deployed in production without extensive security review, regulatory compliance (PCI DSS, RBI guidelines, etc.), and professional validation.
